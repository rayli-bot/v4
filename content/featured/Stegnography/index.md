A new approach of image steganography. With the brand new combination of 2-LSB Encoding, random edge selection and Format Preserving Encryption (FPE). The project decreases the encrypted message size, and prevents anonymous detection on the hidden secret message which protect important data in attacks better than existing LSB and edge-based techniques.
